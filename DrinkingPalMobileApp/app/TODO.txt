 - Load languages from backend using URL: /languages  in GET request
        url returns list of Language Objects as is the Language class in the backend
        look at method in Language service class

 - get the list of bars from URL: /bars with GET and it returns a list of the Bar class in the backend app
        so you must have a similar class to map to in ur app
        the class currently doesn't have pictures, that will be added later

 - prepare the form for creating events from the bar page, for backend communication use /events with POST
        and send an event Object as is the Event class in the backend,
        when creating, you don't have to send the creators id,
        just include the token as the header (call me and i will explain)
